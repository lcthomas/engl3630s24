# Course Calendar
Readings not linked to below can be found on our [Canvas course site](https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/62913/files/folder/course%20readings){:target="_blank"}. Go to Files > course readings.

The most accurate and up-to-date version of this calendar can be found on this site. Use this online calendar to check on reading assignments and other due dates, rather than the pdf or paper version of our syllabus, since those versions of the syllabus will not be updated throughout the semester.

I reserve the right to change the course calendar as needed; adequate advance notice will always be given of any changes.

    * Our class will meet today in Uris Library Classroom B05.

The Classroom is right there. You can also reach it via the main Uris entrance: from the Uris lobby, take the staircase down to the next level and walk straight to the end of the hall. There are signs along the way.
